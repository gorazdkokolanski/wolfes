A bearing is designed to carry tremendous loads while also being soft enough to allow small particles to &quot;
		embed&quot;
		in the bearing material. The various designs of bearings all address these primary needs. In addition,
		a bearing is a sacrificial part,
		in that it is easier and less expensive to replace bearings due to wear,
		than to replace the crankshaft.</font></strong></em></p><p align="left" class="style12"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Coatings come in two basic formulations;
		Solid Film and Dry Film. While the two terms can be and are to a great extent interchangeable,
		when it comes to bearings,
		the differences are important. A Solid Film lubricant derives it's name from the resin film formed during curing. This film has   greater internal bond strength than the bond to the    bearing. A Dry Film, on the other hand, has a weaker internal bond than the bond   to the bearing. When these features are applied to a bearing, the Dry Film is   superior.</font></strong></em></p> <p align="left" class="style12"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since no coating is a 100% friction-free   material, some pressure will be exerted against the coatings. In a rotational   application, such as we are discussing, the coating needs to be able to   MINIMALLY flake away when such pressure is reached. Otherwise, the coating can   delaminate. Generally the particle size that can   be removed is under 1 micron.</font></strong></em></p> <p align="left" class="style12"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The coating is capable of withstanding   pressures in excess of 350,000 psi while lubricating. This is well beyond the   strength of the bearing itself. As pressure increases the coating actually   becomes more lubricious. </font></strong></em></p> <p align="left" class="style12"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the most important features  is it' s ability to maintain it's full lubrication characteristics even in   extremely thin films will be applied in a film thickness of   from .0003&quot; to .001&quot;. Obviously this would affect clearances when the film   approaches .001&quot;. After checking the thickness, burnish with &quot;Scotchbright&quot; or   similar material until the film thickness is no more than .0003&quot;. During   running, the coating will burnish to a near &quot;0&quot; dimension. This characteristic   allows the bearing to be run with it' s normal installed clearance. Coatings that form a &quot;
		harder&quot;
		film will also reduce friction and provide a protective layer to the bearing,
		however,
		as these coatings begin to wear,
		clearances will open up. </font></strong></em></p><p align="left" class="style10"><span class="style15"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to the above features,
		Dry Film can extend the life of a bearing while reducing friction,
		particularly in instances where normal oil film failure could lead to bearing failure...</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></span></p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230520012006id_/http://wolfeblasting.com/IMAGES/BEARING1.jpg" width="89" height="67" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20230520012006id_/http://wolfeblasting.com/IMAGES/BEARING2.jpg" width="89" height="71" /><p align="center"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><a href="CoatingCrankshafts.html">NEXT</a></em></font></strong></p><p align="center"><span class="style11"><a href="MOREREASONSTOCOATYOURPARTS.html">BACK</a></span></p></div>
