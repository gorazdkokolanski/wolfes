            <font size="4">The purpose for having an oil pan is simply to keep the oil from running onto the ground.
              However, the oil pan provides additional functions. It allows the oil to pool at the oil pump pick up and
              it aids in the cooling of the oil. Many people ask to have their oil pans Teflon coated to aid in oil
              shedding. While a speedy return of the oil to the sump is desirable, it may not be the best way to go for
              overall performance. Teflon and similar materials are thermal barriers and would inhibit the pan from
              cooling the oil.</font>

      <font color="#0099FF" size="4"><em><strong>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When coating an oil pan, in most applications, it is important to
              allow the pan to cool the returning oil. It would be better to use a coating that not only has good oil
              shedding abilities, but also helps rather than hinders the ability to transfer heat from the hot oil into
              the pan. In addition, coating the outside of the pan with a thermal dispersant will allow the pan to
              transfer heat from the metal surface to the surrounding air even faster than bare metal. Painting a pan
              for appearance, using a typical paint, can reduce the ability of the pan to radiate heat. Chrome plating
              the pan simply further aggravates the problem. In addition, it has excellent corrosion inhibiting
              characteristics and contains lubricants that reduce the ability of dirt and other debris to accumulate on
              the outside of the pan. This will allow the oil to return to the sump rapidly and help cool the oil as it
              runs over the coated surface. The heat now in the pan will also be transferred to the outside air flow
              faster. </font>

      <font color="#0099FF" size="4"><em><strong>
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> First, by being applied in a very thin coat, it does not
              significantly reduce the surface area of the pan. Second, it contains thermally active ingredients that
              carry heat faster than the bare metal of the pan. The lubricants allow the oil to return to the sump
              faster than over bare metal. The lubricants also reduce the ability of dirt and other debris to stick to
              the surface. Any build up of debris will reduce the surface area of the pan and reduce its ability to shed
              heat. Finally, the coating is a very good corrosion inhibitor. The formation of any oxidation layer,
              either rust on steel or an oxidizing of aluminum, will reduce the ability of the pan to shed heat. When
              all the characteristics are combined, the oil pan functions in the best possible manner. The EXCEPTION to
              the above would be in the case of an engine used in very short competitive periods such as in the case
              with Drag Racing. In these instances, an oil shedding thermal barrier should be used. Thermal Barrier will
              allow the oil to return to the sump faster and at the same time keep the oil from cooling by reducing
              thermal transfer. In Drag Racing and similar activities it is not uncommon for the oil to actually be
              below the optimum temperate and will help keep as much heat as possible in the oil while sitting in the
              staging lanes.</font>
