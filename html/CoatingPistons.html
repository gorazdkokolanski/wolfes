                            parts that should be considered for coating. Coating the piston reduces friction and wear,
                            reduces part operating temperature, can increase horse power and torque, reduce or eliminate
                            detonation, allow higher compression ratios to be utilized and allow tighter piston to wall
                            clearances for a better ring seal.</font>

                        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pistons can be coated with three different systems.
                            They are Dry Film Lubricants, Thermal Barriers and Oil Shedding Coatings. These systems can
                            be beneficial on all pistons whether 4 stroke, 2 stroke, gas, alcohol, diesel, reciprocal or
                            rotary.We will look at the Thermal Barrier coatings first. By retaining minimal heat on the
                            surface of the piston, less heat is transferred to the incoming fuel mixture, leading to a
                            reduction in pre-ignition which leads to detonation. The coatings can also allow heat at the
                            surface to move more evenly over the surface reducing hot spots and the coatings reflect
                            heat into the chamber for more even distribution of heat, allowing more efficient combustion
                            of the fuel. This allows more of the fuel molecules to be oxidized, which in turn, means
                            less fuel is needed for optimum power. The result is an engine that makes more power, can be
                            run with a leaner air/fuel mix and less initial timing and has less thermal expansion due to
                            a reduction in the heat absorbed.By applying a Dry Film Lubricant, friction, galling and
                            wear is reduced. The lubricants are capable of carrying loads beyond the crush point of the
                            piston. In addition, the lubricants are &quot;fluid retaining&quot; materials that actually
                            hold oil to the surface beyond the pressure where the oil would normally be squeezed off.
                            The ability to carry greater loads, up to 350,000 PSI, while increasing lubricity (reduced
                            friction) allows tighter piston to wall clearances to be run. This leads to better sealing
                            with no increase in friction. By applying to the underside of the piston, oil that is
                            splashed onto the piston to cool it will shed rapidly. Heat transfers most rapidly when
                            there is a large difference in temperature. The longer oil clings to a hot surface the
                            hotter the oil becomes. By shedding the cooling oil more rapidly, cooler oil is splashed
                            over the surface more frequently. If the oil &quot;hangs&quot; longer, it absorbes less heat
                            and blocks cooler oil from contacting the hot surface. A cooler piston grows less, allowing
                            tighter piston to wall clearances.</font>
