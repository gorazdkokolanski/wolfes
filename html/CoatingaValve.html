The   purpose behind coating a valve is to extend the part life and reduce friction.   You're dealing with an intake valve and an exhaust valve. We'll look at the   intake valve first.</font></strong></em></font></p> <p><font color="#0099FF" size="4"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The INTAKE valve seals the   combustion chamber on the intake port side of the head. Prior to that, it is   opening to allow air and fuel to enter the combustion chamber. Intake valves   usually do not suffer as severely as exhaust valves which see combustion chamber   temperatures. Therefore, the primary concern is lubricating the valve stem and   seat. We do this by the application of a dry film lubricant . This reduces the friction particularly in engines where oil flow   is restricted to the head. The dry film takes over the bulk of the lubrication   chore. It is still advisable to coat the face of the valve in the combustion   chamber to help retain combustion chamber heat in the chamber. This also reduces   the operating temperature of the valve. It reduces the temperature of the back   of the valve so the incoming air fuel mix does not pick up as much heat from the   valve, as it would, if it were uncoated. Normally, it is not necessary to   thermal barrier coat the back of the valve, though, it can be done if you wish.   Typically, the face is thermal barrier coated and the back and   stem are dry film coated .On the EXHAUST side we have   a more severe environment because the valve is seeing combustion chamber   temperatures, which on a normally aspirated engine, can easily be at 1350F; on   certain engines this can run even higher. So we definitely coat the face of the   valve with a thermal barrier  to reduce the heat that the valve   absorbes. Then coat the back of the stem with a dry film lubricant . Again, it's very critical on the exhaust valve stem because the   heat can reduce the ability of your oil to lubricate. Consequently, the   permanently bonded, high pressure, high temperature lubricants work extremely   well at reducing friction and wear on the valve and the guide. In some cases, it   is advisable to coat the back of the exhaust valve such as on a Titanium valve   where you can have metal erosion due to hot gas and flame passing over the raw   Titanium.  On other valves it is still preferable to coat the   back with the dry film  to contribute to carbon   shedding so you do not get a carbon build-up on the back of the valve which can   create turbulence in the exhaust flow. </font></strong></em></font></p> <p><font color="#0099FF" size="4"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, by coating the back on   both the intake and exhaust valve after all machine work is done, you   permanently bond the lubricant to the areas that will contact the valve seat   thus reducing wear in this area and creating a better long term seal.</font></strong></em></font></p>
