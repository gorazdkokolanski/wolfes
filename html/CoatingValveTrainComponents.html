			<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style34"><em><strong>The valve train sees many
							benefits from the use of Dry Film Lubricants. All of the parts are minimally lubricated by
							engine oil. Consequently, excessive wear is always of concern, especially at start up or
							after the engine has been sitting for an extended period. By using an Extreme Pressure
							Bonded Lubricant we can provide protection well beyond that expected from even the best
							motor oils. The primary components to be coated are the Cam, Lifters, Push Rods and Rocker
							Arms ( Valves will be dealt with separately ). Normal lubrication is provided by a film of
							oil that is either pumped to the contact point or is splashed onto the part. In either
							instance oil film breakdown is of concern. By permanently bonding a lubricating coating in
							place we enhance the ability of the oil to lubricate and provide additional lubrication even
							after the oil film fails. Typical motor oils will fail at pressures below 10,000 psi.
							Properly formulated bonded lubricants can withstand pressure in excess of 350,000
							psi.</strong></em></span></font>

		<p class="style34"><em><strong>
					<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Dry Film Lubricant functions in two ways. First, it
						acts as an &quot;oil retaining material&quot; rather than an oil shedding material, as are some
						materials like Teflon. This means that it reduces the ability of a small amount of oil to flow
						rapidly over the coated surface. In doing this it actually reduces friction as the remaining oil
						slides between the mating surfaces very easily and allows the parts to move much more freely.
						This action also reduces the likelihood of the oil film being &quot;pushed&quot; off the
						surface. A secondary benefit to this action is that it allows the oil to absorb more heat, thus
						helping to cool the parts more efficiently. The enhanced sliding action can be demonstrated by
						the way a &quot;Slip and Slide&quot; functions. This slick piece of plastic does not allow a
						body to slide over it until a film of water is pre sent. A small amount of the water is retained
						by the plastic surface as well as by the skin and clothing . With water running over this slick
						surface, a body will very easily slide for an extended distance. If the surfaces shed water, the
						effect wouldn't be as dramatic. The layers of water moving at different speeds act like little
						&quot;rollers&quot; that allow free movement. The Dry Film Lubricant creates the same effect by
						retaining a small amount of slower moving oil on the coated surface, thus actually allowing
						easier movement of the parts.</font>

		<p class="style32"><span class="style33">
				<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Second function takes over when the oil film would
					normally break down either due to pressure or the effect of high heat on the lubricant and allow
					metal to metal contact. The bonded coating does not &quot;break down&quot; nor cold flow at higher
					pressure nor is it significantly affected by high temperatures, thus maintaining a lubricous film
					between the mating surfaces inhibiting metal to metal contact. This film provides a second layer of
					protection that normally will lubricate at loads in excess of the &quot;crush&quot; or deformation
					point of the base metal. This is especially critical at start up when a well defined mating surface
					is desired and excessive wear due to lack of lubrication can do significant damage. Camshafts
					especially benefit from the application of a Bonded Lubricant at start up where a cam can be damaged
					if the lubricating film is not maintained during break in. The use of a Bonded Lubricant can in many
					instances eliminate the need to break in the cam using low pressure valve springs. When we combine
					these features not only do we see better mating surfaces, we can also expect to see less wear,
					reduced friction and attendant power gains as well as longer part life. In addition, this can allow
					the Performance Engine Builder to reduce the amount of oil flowing to these parts thus directing
					more of the oil flow to the crank assembly.</font>
