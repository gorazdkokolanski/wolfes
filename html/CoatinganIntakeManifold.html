                            intake manifold. The first would be Performance, the second Appearance. Let's discuss
                            Performance first.</font>

                        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this instance, you are dealing with heat that is
                            generated by the engine. You will also acquire heat from the hot oil that may be tossed up
                            under the underside of the intake manifold. This means we want to apply a thermal barrier to
                            the bottom of the intake manifold, the flange area where it would bolt to the head and also
                            the flange area where the carburetor would bolt to the intake manifold. This will reduce the
                            amount of heat that enters the manifold itself, keeping the manifold cooler. Typically, a
                            normally aspirated engine will see a 1% improvement in power for every 10 degree drop in
                            carb air inlet temperature. A Turbo charged engine will see a 2% increase. Keeping the
                            manifold cooler than normal allows an engine to generate more horse power. In addition to
                            this, you would coat the top of the manifold with a thermal dispersant . This means that the
                            heat that does get into the intake manifold will be more rapidly dispersed into the air
                            moving over it, thus cooling the intake manifold further. This gives you a greater chance of
                            creating more horse power by reducing the inlet temperature. You can also coat the inside of
                            the runners in an intake manifold. You can use 1 or 2 coatings. A single coating that we
                            recommend would be our dry film lubricant. These are known as 'fluid retaining coatings' and
                            the fuel/air mix as it passes through an intake manifold on a carbureted engine is treated
                            like a 'fluid in motion'. The coating will have a tendency to create a small amount of
                            boundary layer turbulence which will reduce fuel drop-out. You may also apply a thermal
                            barrier to the inside of a runner first, then the dry film over it. You not only create the
                            boundary layer turbulence, you further reduce the amount of heat that does enter the
                            fuel/air mix.</font>

                                    the top. In this way, while you're inhibiting the amount of heat that can be
                                    dispersed from the top of the manifold because of it being coated, you're reducing
                                    the amount of heat that can be absorbed by the manifold because of the same coating
                                    on the bottom. Thus, you are at least creating an equilibrium and not dealing with a
                                    heat problem. The coating is extremely high temperature resistant, does not blue or
                                    discolor like chrome, does not oxidize significantly as a polished aluminized
                                    surface will, so you can maintain a very nice, high-polished surface not affected by
                                    fuel oils and solvents.</font>
