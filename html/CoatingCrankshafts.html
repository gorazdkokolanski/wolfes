Coatings provide increased lubrication to the journals and aid in shedding oil from the counterweights. Depending on the intended use,
		a different coating may be required for the counterweights. </font></strong></em></p><p class="style14"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The crank journals should be coated with a Dry Film Lubricant. In all cases,
		reduce any excessive build up with Scotch Bright or similar material;
		DO NOT assemble the crank and bearings &quot;
		tight&quot;
		. Properly done,
		there should be no need to change the clearances to allow for the coating. The coating will burnish to a near &quot;
		0&quot;
		dimension during running. </font></strong></em></p><p><span class="style14"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By coating with a dry film lubricant,
		you increase the lubrication levels,
		reducing friction and adding a protective layer. Normally lubrication is provided by a film of oil. The rotational action of a crank coupled with the pressure-fed oiling system,
		aids in keeping a film of oil in place at higher pressures. However,
		when pressures exceed what the oil can carry,
		the oil will flow away from the point</font></strong></em></span><span class="style19"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of contact.

		000 PSI which is well beyond the pressure you would expect to see in use. In addition,
		the coatings are &quot;
		fluid retaining&quot;
		and help keep a layer of oil in place. The coating actually becomes more lubricious or slippery as pressure increases,
		which enhances the protective,
		friction-reducing action. </span></font></span></strong></em></p><p><span class="style14"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The type of lubricating solids used will have a major effect on the ability of the coating to provide the desired protection. Certain ingredients such as &quot;
		Teflon&quot;
		are very slick only at low pressures and rotational speeds. Traditional lubricants like Graphite do not lubricate in environments where moisture is not present.</font></strong></em></span><em><strong><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/WOLFE'S&#32;SANDBLASTING&#32;2.jpg" width="101" height="50" /></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="style14">utilizes Moly as well as other extreme pressure lubricants that can carry tremendous loads while experiencing extremely fast rotational or sliding speeds.
