<h1 align="center" class="style40"><span class="style31">DRY FILM Lubrication Coatings</span></h1>
</p> 
<p align="center" class="style42">Dry film lubricants, also known as solid film lubricants, provide a   lubricating film that reduces friction, inhibits galling and seizing and in some   instances can aid in dispersing heat. The appearance is generally a charcoal   gray and takes on a sheen upon burnishing. They are slippery and provide an   extremely low coefficient of friction.</p> <p align="center" class="style42">The two most important components are the binders and   lubricating ingredients. Without a good binder the coating will not stay in   place and will simply cold flow or buff off in operation. Similar coatings using   the same pigments but different binding systems can show a wide variation in   load carrying abilities, ranging from 100,000 psi to over 350,000 psi . The   pigments determine the actual lubricating potential.  Selecting the proper ingredients can   make or break a coating. </p>

<p align="center" class="style43"><span class="style35">One of the obvious reasons for using a solid or dry film    lubrication coating is to reduce friction. A simple reduction in   friction greatly reduces component interface contact wear, which in turn, frees   up</span> <span class="style35">horsepower typically lost to friction.Polytetrafluoroethylene (generically known   as teflon) has the lowest coefficient of friction of any known solid. For this</span> <span class="style35">single reason engineers for years have experimented using polymers as a solid   lubricant on engine components in an effort to reduce friction. Again, because   of the low coefficient of friction, PTFE (or polymer) powders are added to   engine lubricants to reduce friction and wear between mating components.   However, PTFE is extremely soft and expensive. Fluorocarbons are various   chemically inert compounds containing both carbon and fluorine and are used   mainly in</span> <span class="style35">lubricants and in the making of resins and plastics.   Fluorocarbons are hard. When blending fluorocarbons with fine PTFE particles   along with selected fillers,</span> <span class="style35">binders, and pigments you have a complex matrix   formulation known as a fluoropolymer. A properly formulated dry film coating offers the known friction reducing characteristic of PTFE and fluorocarbons in conjunction with the wear characteristics of the specifically   selected bindersand fillers.</span></p> <p align="center" class="style43"><span class="style35">There are obvious critical areas associated with power loss and   damage caused by inadequate lubrication. Two of the highest frictional contact   surfaces in an internal combustion engine are design situated between the piston   skirts and cylinder walls, and the interfacing contact area of the crankshaft   journals and corresponding rod and main bearings. When introducing high velocity </span><span class="style41"><span class="style27">reciprocating movement, one can only hope that hydrodynamic (boundary)   lubrication is occurring. Wait a minute, how about &quot;cold starts&quot; when all the   oil has drained down off the piston skirts and departed the bearing   surfaces&hellip;isn't the engine literally operating dry! Reason enough for having   components dry film coated. However, don't ignore the Performance   Enhancement benefits of dry film coatings designed to significantly   diminish friction and freeing up wasted energy (horsepower)..</span></span></p> <p align="center"><span class="style42">Gear type oil pumps (wet sumps) require extremely close internal   tolerances to properly scavenge reserve oil from the pan and then force it   through the engine's oiling network. Consequently, during operation there is   substantial friction taking place which is consuming an enormous amount of   energy and is converting this energy into unwanted heat. Once again we have a   &quot;horsepower&quot; thief that can be eliminated. Dry-Film Coating is a moly-based lubricant capable of providing lubrication at levels as high as 350,000 psi. The lubrication aids in preventing scuffing and galling, increasing part life. It also reduces friction, freeing more useable power. This lubricant provides extra protection by preventing damage from oil film failure. Dry-Film Coating is actually impregnated into the metal surface so no dimensional changes are realized. In addition to lubrication, Dry Film Lubricants also help distribute heat so less metal fatigue is caused reducing the chance of part failure.</span></p>
