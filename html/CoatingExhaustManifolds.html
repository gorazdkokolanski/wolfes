          <font color="#0099FF" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Exhaust manifolds can either be a cast
            iron, factory-type manifold or a tube steel header typically used in performance applications, though they
            are becoming very common in OEM applications. There are a variety of reasons for coating an exhaust manifold
            header. #1 Corrosion protection. The manifold will live longer as well as look nicer. Whether it is for
            performance or show, coating an exhaust manifold is valuable to you. #2 The coating is a thermal barrier,
            thus keeping heat within the manifold or header. There are a number of benefits for this. First, by keeping
            heat within the manifold, you're going to accelerate the exhaust gas velocity which reduces back pressure
            and reduces fuel contamination due to reversion. This is a performance benefit. Second, you'll reduce the
            surface temperature of the manifold. This means if a person comes in contact with it, they are less likely
            to be burned and leave skin behind. If there is a component close to it, it will not see as much heat as it
            would with an uncoated manifold. In addition, not as much heat will be radiated under the hood or into the
            engine compartment. This reduces the under hood temperature which, again, reduces the temperature of
            surrounding parts, such as, alternators and starters. It also reduces the amount of heat that can be drawn
            in through the carburetor, which is a secondary performance benefit. There are a variety of coatings that
            can be used on exhaust manifolds or headers.The most popular is our <font color="#FF0000">WOLFESHINE</font>.
            This gives a near-chrome finish, tremendous corrosion protection and is an excellent thermal barrier.We
            recommend on cast iron, due to it's porosity, that a base coat of <font color="#FF0000">WOLFESHINE</font> be
            put down first, then bake, then lightly sand blast, then put the Black Satin on top.We also have an
            insulating base coat for performance applications where <font color="#FF0000">WOLFESHINE</font> is desired.
            This can be applied to the outside of the exhaust manifold or header, cured, lightly sand blasted, then a
            layer of <font color="#FF0000">WOLFESHINE </font>applied over it, cured and polished. This will impart
            higher temperature capability allowing <font color="#FF0000">WOLFESHINE</font> to be run on 9 to 1 motors,
            which typically have an extremely hot exhaust gas. </font>
